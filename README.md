1- We can give the Monthly Income.

2- We can give  the Daily Expenses.

#About the Project
VS Code was used to construct this C++ application. It has many functions that will do various jobs in the program. For example, one function will collect the user's monthly revenue, while another will collect the user's daily expenses. That being the case, all the data will be written into the files. We may also calculate the Total Expenses with the help of another function.
